# Battle Wordle

Unless you have lived under a rock, you will be very familiar with Josh Wardle's game Wordle, that has been bought by the NY Times.

I've always loved playing Wordle, but thought that it would be nice to be able to play with my friends/family and challenge them to a game.

Battle Wordle, let's you do this. 

See it in action at [www.gunnarmallon.com](https://www.gunnarmallon.com/wordgame).

## Node.js

The server side that handles the game lobby and matches up players is based on Node.js with socket.io

## React / Redux

As I am constantly learning how to improve my architecture and code, I decided to slightly over-engineer the program and add a @redux-toolkit architecture around a @react framework. This lends itself nicely for future expansions.
